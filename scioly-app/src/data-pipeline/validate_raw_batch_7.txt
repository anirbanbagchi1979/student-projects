    "explanation": "Mitosis is a process of cell division that results in two genetically identical daughter cells, each with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell. Since diploid cells have two sets of chromosomes, mitosis produces diploid cells from diploid cells. Meiosis, on the other hand, produces haploid gametes."

    "explanation": "The child has genotype XBXCY. The father contributes XY. For the child to have XXY, the father must have contributed an abnormal gamete. If non-disjunction occurred in Meiosis I of the father, he would produce gametes with XY or no sex chromosomes. If the XY gamete is fertilized by a normal XA egg, the result is XAXCY. If the father contributed an XY gamete and the mother contributed an XA gamete, the child would be XAXCY. However, the child is XBXCY. This means the mother contributed XB and the father contributed XBY. This requires non-disjunction in Meiosis I of the father, producing an XY gamete, and the mother contributed XB. The child's genotype is XBXCY. The mother's genotype is XAXB. The father's genotype is XY. The child has Klinefelter syndrome (XXY). The child's genotype is XBXCY. The mother contributes XB.
