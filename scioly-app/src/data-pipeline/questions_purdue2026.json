Core workflow: DNA is fragmented and ligated to adapters. Fragments bind to a flow cell and undergo bridge amplification, forming dense clusters of identical DNA copies. Sequencing occurs through cyclic reversible terminator chemistry: fluorescently labeled nucleotides are added one base at a time. A camera captures fluorescence signals after each cycle, revealing the base sequence. Millions to billions of clusters are sequenced in parallel → high accuracy and short reads.",
