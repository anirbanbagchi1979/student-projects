If the Marquette retriever in this question has the opposite gene (TYR1) on the X chromosome, and the tyrosinase inhibitor is administered, it would still inhibit tyrosinase, which is the enzyme encoded by TYR1. This would prevent the deposition of eumelanin. Therefore, regardless of whether TYR1 is on an autosome or the X chromosome, the tyrosinase inhibitor would prevent eumelanin deposition, leading to a golden or yellow phenotype, assuming the MC1R gene allows for eumelanin production. The previous question focused on the genetic basis of striping, while this question focuses on the effect of an inhibitor on a specific enzyme.",

    "answer": "The lane with only the plasmid would travel farther. Gel electrophoresis separates DNA fragments based on size, with smaller fragments traveling faster and farther through the gel matrix. In the second lane, the plasmid is bound by multiple proteins (DnaA, DnaB, DnaC, and IHF). These proteins increase the overall mass and potentially alter the conformation of the DNA, making the complex larger and thus slower moving. Since the proteins themselves do not significantly affect travel distance when bound to DNA (as stated in the problem), the presence of these proteins will effectively increase the size of the DNA complex, causing it to migrate slower and therefore travel less distance compared to the naked plasmid.",

    "question": "After further examination, you find that the DNA is Z-DNA of about 6360 bp. No nicks are present in the DNA, but there are 27 underwindings. Give the topology of the DNA in terms of L, AL, W, and T. Assume 12 bp/turn.",
    "options": [],
    "answer": "Given: DNA length = 6360 bp, bp/turn = 12, underwindings = 27.\n\n1.  **Twist (T):** The number of base pairs per turn is 12. So, T = Total bp / bp/turn = 6360 / 12 = 530 turns.\n\n2.  **Underwinding:** The DNA is underwound by 27 turns. This means the actual number of turns is less than the theoretical number of turns if it were in B-DNA form. However, the question states 'underwindings', which usually refers to a negative change in linking number. In the context of Z-DNA, it's a specific conformation. Let's interpret 'underwindings' as a reduction in the number of turns from a standard B-DNA form. If we assume a standard B-DNA has 10.5 bp/turn, then the number of turns in B-DNA would be 6360/10.5 ≈ 605.7. However, the problem states to assume 12 bp/turn for calculation. So, let's use that for the base calculation.\n\nLet's re-evaluate 'underwindings'. In topology, underwinding typically refers to a decrease in the linking number (L) from a relaxed state. If we consider the relaxed state to have a certain number of turns based on the given bp/turn, then underwinding means fewer turns. However, Z-DNA itself has a different helical structure. The question might be implying a deviation from a relaxed state. Let's assume the 'underwindings' refers to a change in the linking number. If we consider the number of turns in a relaxed state to be T = 530 (based on 12 bp/turn), and there are 27 underwindings, this means the linking number is reduced by 27.\n\nLet's assume the question implies that the DNA is underwound by 27 turns relative to a relaxed state with 12 bp/turn. So, the actual number of turns is 530 - 27 = 503 turns.\n\n3.  **Linking Number (L):** L = Number of turns. So, L = 503.\n\n4.  **Writhe (W):** The change in linking number due to supercoiling is the sum of twist and writhe. L = T + W.  If we consider the 'underwindings' as a change in the linking number, then L = T - 27.  However, the question asks for L, AL, W, and T.  Let's assume T is the number of turns in the relaxed state (530).  Then L = T + W.  If there are 27 underwindings, it means the DNA is more tightly coiled or has undergone some topological change.  Let's assume 'underwindings' refers to a negative change in the linking number relative to a relaxed state.  So, L = 530 - 27 = 503.\n\n5.  **Twist (T):** The twist is the number of helical turns.  If we assume the 12 bp/turn is the intrinsic twist, then T = 530.\n\n6.  **Writhe (W):**  W = L - T = 503 - 530 = -27.\n\n7.  **Actual Linking Number (AL):** This is the same as L, which is 503.\n\nLet's re-read the question carefully. '27 underwindings'. This usually implies a negative change in the linking number. If we consider the relaxed state to have a certain number of turns, then underwinding means fewer turns. If we assume the relaxed state has 530 turns (based on 12 bp/turn), then underwinding by 27 means the linking number is 530 - 27 = 503.\n\nSo, the values are:\n*   **L (Linking Number):** 503\n*   **AL (Actual Linking Number):** 503\n*   **W (Writhe):** L - T.  If T is the number of turns in the relaxed state (530), then W = 503 - 530 = -27.\n*   **T (Twist):** This is the number of helical turns.  If we assume the 12 bp/turn is the intrinsic twist, then T = 530.\n\nHowever, Z-DNA itself has a different twist per base pair. Z-DNA has about 12 bp per turn and a left-handed helix. The term 'underwinding' might be used loosely here. If we strictly follow the formula L = T + W, and assume T is the number of turns in the relaxed state (530), and 'underwinding' means W = -27, then L = 530 - 27 = 503.\n\nLet's consider another interpretation: 'underwinding' refers to the change in linking number. If the DNA is relaxed, L = T. If it's underwound, L < T. If it's overwound, L > T.  The problem states '27 underwindings'.  This implies that the linking number is 27 less than it would be in a relaxed state.  If we assume the relaxed state has 530 turns (based on 12 bp/turn), then L = 530 - 27 = 503.\n\nLet's assume the question is asking for the topological parameters of this specific Z-DNA molecule.\n\n*   **Twist (T):** The number of helical turns.  Given 12 bp/turn, T = 6360 bp / 12 bp/turn = 530 turns.\n*   **Linking Number (L):**  The linking number is the number of times one strand of DNA winds around the other.  It is related to the twist and writhe by L = T + W.  The problem states '27 underwindings'.  This implies that the linking number is reduced.  If we consider the relaxed state to have T turns, then underwinding by 27 means L = T - 27.  So, L = 530 - 27 = 503.\n*   **Writhe (W):**  W = L - T = 503 - 530 = -27.\n*   **AL (Actual Linking Number):** This is the same as L, so AL = 503.\n\nTherefore, the topology is:\n*   **L = 503**\n*   **AL = 503**\n*   **W = -27**\n*   **T = 530**",

    "question": "What elements of the DNA topology would change if the DNA was nicked? What would their new values be?",
    "options": [],
    "answer": "If the DNA was nicked (a break in one strand), the DNA would become relaxed, and the writhe (W) would become zero. The linking number (L) would become equal to the twist (T) of the relaxed DNA. The twist (T) would remain the same as the number of helical turns in the relaxed state (530 turns, assuming 12 bp/turn). The actual linking number (AL) would also become equal to the twist.\n\nSo, if the DNA was nicked:\n*   **L:** Would become equal to T (530).\n*   **AL:** Would become equal to T (530).\n*   **W:** Would become 0.\n*   **T:** Would remain 530 (assuming the nick allows it to relax to this state).",

    "options": [],
    "answer": "Giemsa staining is used to visualize chromosomes and identify banding patterns, which are crucial for detecting chromosomal abnormalities. Euchromatin is loosely packed DNA that is transcriptionally active, while heterochromatin is densely packed and transcriptionally inactive. If all genetic material were euchromatin, the chromosomes would appear uniformly stained and would lack the distinct banding patterns that are normally visible with Giemsa staining. This would make it very difficult, if not impossible, to identify specific chromosomes, detect translocations, deletions, or other structural abnormalities. The karyotype would likely appear as a uniform, undifferentiated mass of genetic material, rendering it largely uninterpretable for diagnostic purposes.",
